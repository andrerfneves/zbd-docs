While you can use the [Send Bitcoin to ZBD Gamertag](/api/gamertag/send-payment) endpoint to make a direct payment to a ZBD user, if you want to create a regular Lightning Network Invoice / Charge QR code for that given user, you can do so using the [`/gamertag/charges`](/api/gamertag/create-charge) endpoint.

In order to request Charges from a user's Gamertag you just need to make a simple API call with a payload like the example below.

| Property | Status | Description |
| --- | :-: | :-: |
| Endpoint | [`/gamertag/create-charge`](/api/gamertag/create-charge) | ZEBEDEE API endpoint to use. |
| HTTP Method | `POST` | The type of HTTP request to invoke. |
| Authentication | `apikey` | How the API request is authenticated by ZBD Platform. |

For the `data` portion of the POST request, you can use the following payload as an example:

```json
{
  "gamertag": "andre",
  "amount": "15000",
  "internalId": "12347ahk1n",
  "description": "ZBD so fast!",
  "callbackUrl": "https://your-app.com/zbd-callback"
}
```

In order to receive updates about the status of this request, make sure to include a `callbackUrl` in the `data` portion of the request.

The response payload will include a **`invoiceRequest`** which is the contents of the payment request QR code.

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "status": "CHARGE_PENDING",
    "amount": "15000",
    "internalId": "12347ahk1n",
    "description": "ZBD so fast!",
    "invoiceRequest": "lnbc100n1pskq45xpp5q5rtpfzydndqk4fu2y4h64fdc284y6av0fn8gz4dmkq89xuxd28sdpvw3jhxarfdenjqctxw3jhygrjv4kk7anfdenjqmnpd4jscqzpgxqzjcsp59g6vgrss790zkwjqc3adndzt5tcq2ltaxynfstggjl6rre3kk6js9qyyssqfyan62pzsjsm62l6zq57jv9pmlpmycvqu649ccfjn7mar77awgykz2gft3fcgl9x5m4mz78nyng920uf6zwft5qnt2qjtqgpl7c72dgq4z7mgv",
    "invoiceExpiresAt": "2021-10-08T14:42:38.759Z",
    "unit": "msats",
    "createdAt": "2022-02-08T14:32:38.793Z"
  },
  "message": "Successfully created charge request for gamertag"
}
```

<Info>Charges / Payment Requests have defined expiration times. After a Charge expires it cannot be paid, but you can simply create another one.</Info>

Once a payment is made and the Charge settles, the ZBD User will receive a Push Notification alerting them they've been sent some Bitcoin.

## In-Game Multiplayer Commerce through ZBD Gamertags[​](#in-game-multiplayer-commerce-through-zbd-gamertags "Direct link to heading")

For Developers that wish to provide a more robust commerce experience for their gamers, requesting an invoice from ZBD Gamertags can be one of the ways. **Think of yourself, the Developer, as the Orchestrator of payments.** By leveraging Lightning Network invoices tied to specific ZBD Gamertags, you can ensure that the payment is made to the correct user, and that the payment has truly settled.

### Two-Step Payment Orchestration[​](#two-step-payment-orchestration "Direct link to heading")

Let's say **Alice** wants to buy a sword from **Bob** inside of the game. Well that's easy, and there's two ways:

#### ZBD Gamertag Charges[​](#zbd-gamertag-charges "Direct link to heading")

You can use the above endpoint to create a Charge from **Bob**'s ZBD Gamertag, and display it for **Alice** to pay. Pass a `callbackUrl` on the ZBD API request and when the payment settles, you will be alerted of it and can then transfer the sword asset inside the game.

**Yes, it's really that simple!**

#### Game Wallet as Escrow[​](#game-wallet-as-escrow "Direct link to heading")

Alternatively you could rely on the Game's own Wallet as a form of escrow. You can create a Charge using the `/charges` endpoint passing a `callbackUrl` to receive settlement updates, and have **Alice** pay it.

<Info>Alice will effectively be paying the Game Wallet in this scenario.</Info>

Once payment is settled, you can use the [Send Bitcoin to ZBD Gamertag](/api/gamertag/send-payment) endpoint and send the same amount to **Bob**. When this second payment settles you can then transfer the sword asset inside the game.

While this technically involves two transactions, it provides a bit more control to the Developer that wishes to manage the transfer of assets/in-game items a bit more closely and with more checks and balances in place. Both approaches are recommended.
