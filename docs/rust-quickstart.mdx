## Prerequisites

To complete this guide, you will need the following:

- [ZBD Project with a Live API key](/docs/getting-started)
    - create an environment variable called ZBD_API_KEY
- [rust and cargo installed through rustup](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)

## 1. Create a rust project

```bash
cargo new <project-name>
cd <project-name>
```

## 2. Add dependencies to your project

Add the ZBD and tokio crates:

<CodeGroup>

```bash
cargo add zebedee-rust tokio
```

</CodeGroup>

## 3. Update your Cargo.toml to use full features in tokio
```
[package]
name = "zbd-rust"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2021"

# See more keys and their definitions at https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/manifest.html

[dependencies]
tokio = { version = "1.29.1", features = ['full']}
zebedee-rust = "0.4.4"
```

4. Create a charge
- open `main.rs` and add the following code
```
use std::env;
use zebedee_rust::{charges::*, ZebedeeClient};

#[tokio::main]
async fn main(){
    let apikey: String = end::var("ZBD_API_KEY").unwrap();
    let zbd_client = ZebedeeClient::new().apikey(apikey).build();

    let charge = Charge{
        amount: String::from("5000"),
        ..Default::default()
    };

    let charges_res = zbd_client.create_charge(&charge).await.unwrap();

    println!("{:?}", charge_res);
}
```

5. Try it yourself
- Run the following command to create your charge:
`cargo run`
- You can now create charges using the ZBD API!

<Info>Charges and payment requests are usually shown to users as QR codes that can be scanned by mobile apps (e.g. [ZBD](https://zbd.one/download)). Read [Callbacks](/yo) to understand how to receive updates about your payment asynchronously.</Info>
