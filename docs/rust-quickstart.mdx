## Prerequisites

To complete this guide, you will need the following:

- [ZBD Project with a Live API key](/docs/dashboard/projects/api)
- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) and [cargo](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) installed

## 1. Create a Rust project

```bash
cargo new <project-name>
cd <project-name>
```

## 2. Install dependencies

Add both the `zebedee-rust` and `tokio` crates to your project:

```bash
cargo add zebedee-rust tokio
```

## 3. Update your Cargo.toml

Update your `Cargo.toml` file to use full features in tokio.

```yaml
[package]
name = "zbd-rust"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2021"

# See more keys and their definitions at https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/manifest.html

[dependencies]
tokio = { version = "1.29.1", features = ['full']}
zebedee-rust = "0.4.4"
```

## 4. Create a Charge

Open your project's `main.rs` file and add the following code:

```rust
use std::env;
use zebedee_rust::{charges::*, ZebedeeClient};

#[tokio::main]
async fn main(){
    let apikey: String = env::var("ZBD_API_KEY").unwrap();
    let zbd_client = ZebedeeClient::new().apikey(apikey).build();

    let charge = Charge{
        amount: String::from("5000"),
        ..Default::default()
    };

    let charges_res = zbd_client.create_charge(&charge).await.unwrap();

    println!("{:?}", charge_res);
}
```

<Tip>Make sure to create an environment variable called **ZBD_API_KEY** in your Rust project. This is the API key you get from your ZBD Project.</Tip>

Run the following command to create your charge:

```bash
cargo run
```

You can now create charges using the ZBD and Rust!

<Info>Charges and payment requests are usually shown to users as QR codes that can be scanned by mobile apps (e.g. [ZBD](https://zbd.one/download)). Read [Callbacks](/api-reference/callbacks) to understand how to receive updates about your payment asynchronously.</Info>

## 5. Try it yourself

You can now begin receiving instant Bitcoin payments with Rust + ZBD!
