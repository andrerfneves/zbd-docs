## Prerequisites

To complete this guide, you will need the following:

- [ZBD Project with a Live API key](/docs/dashboard/projects/api)
- [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/)

## 1. Create project

Create a new project or open an existing project in Visual Studio.

## 2. Install the ZBD NuGet package

NuGet package name: `dev.zbd.csharp`

<CodeGroup>
```bash Package Manager
NuGet\Install-Package dev.zbd.csharp 
```
```bash .NET CLI
dotnet add package dev.zbd.csharp 
```
```xml Package Reference
<PackageReference Include="dev.zbd.csharp" Version="0.1.1" />
```
</CodeGroup>

## 3. Send and receive Bitcoin

The below code is an example of how you can create a charge.
```csharp
using ZebedeeAPI;

var handler = new ZebedeeHandler("<YOUR_ZBD_API_KEY>");

var charge =
    await handler.CreateCharge(
        expiresIn: "10000", 
        amount: "100000", 
        description: "A Charge Created with ZBD!"
    );

Console.WriteLine(charge.data.invoice.request);
```

You're looking for the `data.invoice.request` property in the JSON response. It starts with `lnbc1` and is the payment request anyone in the Bitcoin Lightning Network can use to pay you.

```

<Info>Charges and payment requests are usually shown to users as QR codes that can be scanned by mobile apps (e.g. [ZBD](https://zbd.one/download)). Read [Callbacks](/api-reference/callbacks) to understand how to receive updates about your payment asynchronously.</Info>
