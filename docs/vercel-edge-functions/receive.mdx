## Prerequisites

To complete this guide, you will need the following:

- [ZBD Project with a Live API key](/docs/dashboard/projects/api)
- [Vercel account](https://vercel.com/signup) + [Vercel CLI installed](https://vercel.com/docs/cli#installing-vercel-cli)

## 1. Create a Next.js Project

Follow the prompts on the create-next-app CLI to create a new project, and then change into the directory of your project.

```bash
yarn create next-app <project-name>
```

```bash
cd <project-name>
```

## 2. Write an Edge Function

<Note>For this guide we will be making use of the [App Router](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/route-handlers) inside of Next.js.</Note>

Create a new file in the `app/api/request/route.ts` that creates a Bitcoin Lightning Charge (payment request) with the following code:


<CodeGroup>

```javascript app/api/request/route.ts
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server';

export const runtime = 'edge';
export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic';

const ZBD_BASE_URL = 'https://api.zebedee.io';
const ZBD_API_KEY = 'b7YW3s2JzZKGcXjIf5Dqof8wjKT2RuWr8';

export async function GET() {
  const res = await fetch(`${ZBD_BASE_URL}/v0/charges`, {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      'apikey': `${ZBD_API_KEY}`,
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      amount: '100000', // 100 satoshis (100,000 msats) -- ~$0.03
      description: 'Money at internet speed', // What is this payment request for?
    }),
  });

  if (res.ok) {
    const data = await res.json();
    return NextResponse.json(data);
  }
}
```

</CodeGroup>

## 3. Create payment request locally

Run function locally:

```bash
npx next dev
```

Opening your browser to the following URL: `http://localhost:3000/api/request` should return a JSON response with a payment request.

You can also test this using curl command:

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/request
```

You're looking for the `data.invoice.request` property in the JSON response. It starts with `lnbc1` and is the payment request anyone in the Bitcoin Lightning Network can use to pay you.

```

<Info>Charges and payment requests are usually shown to users as QR codes that can be scanned by mobile apps (e.g. [ZBD](https://zbd.one/download)). Read [Callbacks](/api-reference/callbacks) to understand how to receive updates about your payment asynchronously.</Info>

## 4. Create payment request in production

Deploy your project to Vercel:

```bash
vercel
```

Opening your browser to the following URL: `https://project-name.vercel.app/api/request` should now return this in production.

You can also test this using curl command:

```bash
curl https://project-name.vercel.app/api/request
```

## 5. Try it yourself

You can now begin receiving instant Bitcoin payments on the edge with Vercel + ZBD!
