## Prerequisites

To complete this guide, you will need the following:

- [ZBD Project with a Live API key](/docs/getting-started)
- [Vercel account](https://vercel.com/signup) + [Vercel CLI installed](https://vercel.com/docs/cli#installing-vercel-cli)

## 1. Create a Next.js Project

Follow the prompts on the create-next-app CLI to create a new project, and then change into the directory of your project.

```bash
yarn create next-app <project-name>
```

```bash
cd <project-name>
```

## 2. Write an Edge Function

<Note>For this guide we will be making use of the [App Router](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/route-handlers) inside of Next.js.</Note>

Create a new file in the `app/api/send/route.ts` that makes a payment to a [Lightning Address](/knowledge-base/glossary) (e.g. andre@zbd.gg) with the following code:

<CodeGroup>

```javascript app/api/send/route.ts
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server';

export const runtime = 'edge';
export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic';

const ZBD_BASE_URL = 'https://api.zebedee.io';
const ZBD_API_KEY = 'b7YW3s2JzZKGcXjIf5Dqof8wjKT2RuWr8';

export async function GET() {
  const res = await fetch(`${ZBD_BASE_URL}/v0/ln-address/send-payment`, {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      'apikey': `${ZBD_API_KEY}`,
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      lnAddress: 'andre@zbd.gg', // Who is the recipient of the payment?
      amount: '100000', // 100 satoshis (100,000 msats) -- ~$0.03
      comment: 'Money at internet speed', // What is this payment for?
    }),
  });

  if (res.ok) {
    const data = await res.json();
    return NextResponse.json(data);
  }
}
```

</CodeGroup>

## 3. Send payment locally

<Warning>
  In order to successfully send payments through the API, you must have an active balance in the ZBD Project you are using. [Learn more about depositing funds into a ZBD Project wallet](/yo).

  If you do not have funds in the ZBD Project you are using, you will receive a 4xx error from the API.
</Warning>

Run function locally:

```bash
npx next dev
```

Opening your browser to the following URL: `http://localhost:3000/api/send` should return a JSON response with the payment sent message.

You can also test this using curl command:

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/send
```

You're looking for the `status` of `completed` to know that the payment settled successfully. 

<Info>Payments in the Lightning Network are asynchronous so you may see a response stating the payment is `processing`. This is expected -- use the `callbackUrl` property to receive updates about your payments.</Info>

## 4. Send payment in production

Deploy your project to Vercel:

```bash
vercel
```

Opening your browser to the following URL: `https://project-name.vercel.app/api/send` should now return this in production.

You can also test this using curl command:

```bash
curl https://project-name.vercel.app/api/send
```

## 5. Try it yourself

You can now begin sending instant Bitcoin payments on the edge with Vercel + ZBD!
