Now that ZBD Shield is protecting your ZBD Project API Key, you need to route transactions from your project through ZBD Shield.

If you've previously used the [ZBD API](/api-reference/introduction), you'll be familiar with the typical ZBD domain and endpoints, however, transactions for ZBD Shield will be routed through different endpoints. 

<Warning>Any transactions processed through the standard endpoints will not be routed through ZBD Shield, and will thus not be protected by ZBD Shield.</Warning>

## Prepare Transaction Payload

To process a transaction through ZBD Shield, you need the following JSON transaction payload:

```
{
  // Required - gamertag for the user withdrawing from the game
  "gamerTag": "freeberty098", 
  // Required - amount of funds, in milisats
  "amount": "1000", 
  // Optional - transaction description shown to the user; default is "Thank you"
  "description": "From Sarutobi's game to freeberty098", 
	// Required - platform the user is on; possible values: PC | Android | iOS | Mac | Web
  "platform": "PC",
	// Required - Your game's version the user is on
  "appVersion": "1.0.0",
	// Optional - if Shield is configured to block non-google play installs then it's required
  "isGooglePlay": true,
	// Required - tells that app is running on a real device, must be true 
  "isDevice": true,
	// Required - the user's unique device id
	"deviceId": "a3k034a0c403af2c3e36119c2c62f3ff477029e3786f1db41ba363119f5e8077",
	// Required - name of your game
	"appId": "App identification",
	// Optional - required if device versions was set on Shield config; possible values: an object string containing all user's device info including "operatingSystem"
	"deviceInfo": "{\"operatingSystem\": \"iOS\"}",
	// Optional - but required if device versions was set on Shield config 
	"deviceVersionNumber": "2.3.1"
}
```

## Authenticate

To authenticate the request, you will need your ZBD Shield Access Token. 

You can get this by going to `Settings` -> `Access Token`

<Note>Generate your key for the first time by pressing the `Regenerate` button.</Note>

<br />

<Warning>Regenerating your Access Token will disable all previous Access Tokens.</Warning>

## Send Transaction

To send a transaction, use the following endpoint with the applicable payload and valid API key.

```
https://{your.Shield.domain}/api/v1/zbd/create-transaction
```

For example:

```
curl --location '{ShieldURL}/api/v1/zbd/create-transaction' \
--header 'Access-Token: {YourShieldAccessToken}' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
    "gamerTag": "",
    "amount": "",
    "description": "",
    "platform": "",
    "appVersion": "",
    "isGooglePlay": bool,
    "isDevice": bool,
    "deviceId": "",
    "appId": "",
    "deviceInfo": "",
    "deviceVersionNumber": ""
}'
```

Congrats! These transactions will route through your ZBD Shield instance. 

## Cooldown

To prevent the same user from requesting multiple times in rapid succession, there is a `cooldown` wherein ZBD Shield will block additional requests until the cooldown period has elapsed. 

This can be changed via API on the following endpoint:

```
 https://{your.Shield.domain}/api/v1/zbd/config/set
```

Example body:

```
{
   "coolDownPeriod": 10  // time, in seconds
}
```

That's it! You're now able to process transactions through ZBD Shield.
