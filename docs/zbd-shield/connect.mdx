title: 'Connect your Project to ZBD Shield'

Now that ZBD Shield is protecting your Project Wallet, you need to route transactions from your game through ZBD Shield.

If you’ve previously used the ZEBEDEE API, you’ll be familiar with the typical ZEBEDEE domain and endpoints (e.g. `https://api.zebedee.io/v0/...`, described in our [API Reference](https://api-reference.zebedee.io)), however, transactions for ZBD Shield will be routed through different endpoints. Any transactions processed through the standard endpoints will not be routed through ZBD Shield, and will thus not be protected by ZBD Shield.

For maximum security, transactions have to be encrypted, then scrambled, then assembled, then sent to ZBD Shield.
