Now that ZBD Shield is protecting your ZBD Project Wallet, you need to route transactions from your game through ZBD Shield.

If you've previously used the ZBD API, you'll be familiar with the typical ZBD domain and endpoints (e.g. `https://api.zebedee.io/v0/...`, described in our [API Reference](/api-reference/introduction), however, transactions for ZBD Shield will be routed through different endpoints. **Any transactions processed through the standard endpoints will not be routed through ZBD Shield**, and will thus not be protected by ZBD Shield.

For maximum security, transactions have to be encrypted, then scrambled, then assembled, then sent to ZBD Shield. For details on this process get in touch with your ZBD Customer agent.
