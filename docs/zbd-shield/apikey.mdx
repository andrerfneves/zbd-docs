# Add an API Key to ZBD Shield

Connecting a [ZBD Dev Dashboard](https://dashboard.zebedee.io) Project to ZBD Shield is required to route transactions for that Project through your ZBD Shield instance. This will be done by inputting the applicable Project’s API key from the Dev Dashboard into ZBD Shield.

## In the Dev Dashboard…[​](#in-the-developer-dashboard "Direct link to heading")

1.  In a separate tab, log in to your [Dev Dashboard](https://dashboard.zebedee.io) account

If you do not have a [ZBD Dev Dashboard](https://dashboard.zebedee.io) account, please create one now ([here's a guide](/docs/dashboard/signup) if you need help).

2.  Navigate to the applicable Project

Once you have your API key, you’re ready to insert it into ZBD Shield.

## Back to ZBD Shield…[​](#back-to-zbd-shield "Direct link to heading")

Now, we need to put that API key into ZBD Shield, so the two are linked.

1.  Return to your ZBD Shield instance
    
2.  Go to `Settings`
    
3.  Go to `API Key`
    
4.  Paste your API key and press the checkmark button to save the entry

danger

If your API key is ever compromised, immediately [regenerate a new API key](/docs/dashboard/projects/api) in the [Dev Dashboard](https://dashboard.zebedee.io) and update the key in your ZBD Shield instance.

Congratulations! You’ve now linked a ZBD Project Wallet to your ZBD Shield instance.
