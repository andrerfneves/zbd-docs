Each ZBD Shield instance runs on a unique subdomain and requires unique login credentials. These are different login credentials than your [ZBD Dev Dashboard](https://dashboard.zebedee.io) account.

## Enter your unique ZBD Shield URL

To access your ZBD Shield account, navigate to the URL link provided by the ZBD team. It should resemble:

```
https://{yourShieldDomain}.zebedeepowered.com
```

## Login to your ZBD Shield instance    

Once on the `Login` screen, use the provided `username` and `password` to sign in.
    
<Frame caption="ZBD Shield | Login">
  <img src="/img/v2/shield-login.png" alt="ZBD Shield | Login" />
</Frame>
<br />

Once logged in, you should see a screen like this.

<Frame caption="ZBD Shield | Anomaly Screen">
  <img src="/img/v2/shield-anomaly.png" alt="ZBD Shield | Anomaly Screen" />
</Frame>

That was easy! Now that weâ€™re logged in, we need to the ZBD API Key for the Project we want to protect with this ZBD Shield instance.
