# ZBD Shield FAQs

### What does ZBD Shield do?[​](#what-does-zbd-shield-do "Direct link to heading")

ZBD Shield helps protect you from malicious and/or fraudulent activity by acting as a middleman between your project and the [ZBD API](/knowledge-base/zebedee-api/overview). The product helps you take action against bad actors by preventing transactions on entities (ZBD Gamertags, IPs, ISPs, and Device IDs).

### What does it mean to "ban" or "allow" an entity?[​](#what-does-it-mean-to-ban-or-allow-an-entity "Direct link to heading")

*   `Banning` an entity prevents the entity from transacting, even if their IP/ISP/Gamertag was previously allowed
*   `Allowing` an entity enables an entity to transact, even if their IP/ISP/Gamertag was previously banned

### What are "Game Version Restrictions"?[​](#what-are-game-version-restrictions "Direct link to heading")

ZBD Shield allows you to block withdrawals from only specified versions (i.e. builds) of your game. This is so that you can patch bugs/exploits/etc. in a new build, and prevent transactions on previous versions that have bugs. Therefore, only versions of your game listed in ZBD Shield will process transactions.

### What happens if ZBD Shield goes down?[​](#what-happens-if-zbd-shield-goes-down "Direct link to heading")

Your project should still work if ZBD Shield fails. If ZBD Shield is, unexpectedly, unavailable, you could temporarily halt withdrawals and inform your user of the situation, or route transactions through the normal endpoints.
