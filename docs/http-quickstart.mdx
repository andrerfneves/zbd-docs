description: Learn how to use ZBD API using HTTP calls.
---

## Prerequisites

To complete this guide, you will need the following:

- [ZBD Project with a Live API key](/docs/getting-started)
- [cURL](https://curl.se/), [httpie](https://httpie.io/), [wget](https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/) or any other HTTP client

## 1. Create payment request

To create a [Charge](/knowledge-base/glossary#charge) on the Bitcoin Lightning Network, use the [Charges HTTP API](/api-reference/charges/create):

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url https://api.zebedee.io/v0/charges \
  --header 'apikey: <apikey>' \
  --data '{
    "amount": "100000",
    "description": "Charging for the coffee!"
  }'
```

Check the `data.invoice.request` property on the response payload for the contents of the payment request QR code.

## 2. Send payment to Bitcoin Lightning invoice

You can pay a Bitcoin Lightning payment request, or [Charge](/knowledge-base/glossary#charge), by leveraging the [Payments HTTP API](/api-reference/payments/send):

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url https://api.zebedee.io/v0/payments \
  --header 'apikey: YOUR_API_KEY_HERE' \
  --data '{
    "description": "SaaS payment",
    "invoice": "lnbc1u1pjwejp4pp5pqm0wsg8z9ga7fl08wns429y2wr7c40s4cvws9wuccc5ekt74pcqdqhtfz5y32yg4zjqsmgv9exwegcqzzsxqzjcsp5uxmw8dqc3z2g9ed23s4xy5l97uaw5u9207wezwrg02vxeunf8l9s9qyyssq4yfrmu0vnhjx2kvzhqgacwlz3ptak9mkkvs7xwtcvs3frt34aetrjha6amehs7335eaewap0cna6nmz3rdjj7x3ufs4687k4a64drvcpwmel4q"
  }'
```

Check the `data.status` property on the response payload to know if the payment was successful. Check [Callbacks](/api-reference/callbacks) to understand how to get async payments from ZBD.

## 3. Send payment to Lightning Address

To send an instant Bitcoin payment to a [Lightning Address](/knowledge-base/guides/lightning-address) (e.g. andre @ zbd.gg), you can use the [Lightning Address HTTP API](/api-reference/lightning-address/send):

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url https://api.zebedee.io/v0/ln-address/send-payment \
  --header 'apikey: YOUR_API_KEY_HERE' \
  --data '{
    "amount": "10000",
    "lnAddress": "andre@zbd.gg",
    "comment": "Thanks for the coffee!"
  }'
```

Check the `data.status` property on the response payload to know if the payment was successful. Check [Callbacks](/api-reference/callbacks) to understand how to get async payments from ZBD.
