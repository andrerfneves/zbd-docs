**ZBD Streamer is a platform-agnostic streaming toolkit to interact with your live audience through Bitcoin Lightning Network nanotransactions**.

As a streamer using ZBD Streamer you can earn Bitcoin by letting your fans send you tips straight to your ZEBEDEE App which trigger GIFs/memes animations on-stream. Because it's a web-first platform, ZBD Streamer is able to connect to any and all streaming software like OBS and vMix. It really doesn't matter where you stream to.

Main benefits include:

*   You retain a higher percentage of tip revenue. Most platforms charge upwards of 30%; we charge 1%.
*   You open up new revenue streams. Users who have or earn bitcoin want additional avenues for spending their sats to reward content creators.
