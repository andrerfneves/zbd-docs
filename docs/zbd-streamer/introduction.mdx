## What is ZBD Streamer?

ZBD Streamer is a platform-agnostic streaming toolkit to interact with your live audiences through Bitcoin Lightning Network transactions.

As a streamer using ZBD Streamer you can earn Bitcoin by letting your fans send you tips straight to your ZBD App which trigger GIFs/memes animations on-stream. Because it's a web-first platform, ZBD Streamer is able to connect to any and all streaming software like OBS and vMix. It really doesn't matter where you stream to.
