New features are coming to ZBD Streamer, including text-to-speech, audio snippet support, and much more. However, the system was purposefully-built open enough that more tech-savyy folks can do custom things with it.

## Tapping into Payments to ZBD Streamer

You can reuse the QR code from your [ZBD Streamer](https://streamer.zebedee.io) account and have it power things other than just the main GIFs + superchat module inside your favorite streaming tool.

To do so you must grab the **`rk`** code from the `Alert URL`.

```bash Alert URL
 https://streamer.zebedee.io/o/alert?rk=CODE_HERE
```

Create a new URL like so:

```bash New Custom Events URL
https://streamer-backend.zebedee.io/events/CODE_HERE
```

## SSE Event Streamer

This new URL is an SSE event streamer that fires a JSON object every time someone makes a payment to your ZBD Streamer QR code.

<Tip>You can use a simple **`curl https://streamer-backend.zebedee.io/events/CODE_HERE`** to view the payment stream directly on a terminal window.</Tip>

Each payment payload object in the SSE stream contains the amount, the payer name, and comment (if available). **With this information one can plug any payment to the ZBD Streamer QR code and have it power any other event in any other system.** One could build an entire separate UI for showing these payments inside of the stream, or you could set it up to activate a fog machine or turn off the lights. Imagination is your limits here.

See [SSE Documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventSource) to learn more about SSE event streams.
