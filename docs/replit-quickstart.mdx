As a Bitcoin payments API infrastructure provider, one of the many items we aim to always improve upon is `developer time to payment` — how long does it take for a new ZEBEDEE developer to perform their first global Bitcoin payment?

Because of that, our team is always focused on introducing new ways to quickly get started in a secure server environment and interacting with the ZEBEDEE API or SDKs.

Replit is an online integrated development environment (IDE) that allows users to write, run, and collaborate on code directly from their web browser. Basically, any developer can spin up an entire development environment on the language of their choosing, and go from first code commit to full production deployment all in the same web interface.

Add the flexibility developers have with cloud-based IDEs like Replit, to the simplicity of the ZEBEDEE API for global instant Bitcoin payments and you have a winner!

### 3-min Walkthrough
Head on over to [Replit.com](https://replit.com/) and create a free account if you don’t already have one.

Once you’re in, find the [zebedee-nextjs-dev-playground](https://replit.com/@andrerfneves/zebedee-nextjs-dev-playground?v=1) template here:

https://replit.com/@andrerfneves/zebedee-nextjs-dev-playground

  <img src="/img/docs/replit-quickstart/replit-dev-playground.png" alt="zebedee-nextjs-dev-playground Replit Template" />
</Frame>

Click the **USE TEMPLATE** button on top right and give your new project a name. Your repl instance will begin to boot up and you’ll see the robust IDE interface from Replit begin to take shape in the page.

</Frame>

We’re basically done, now just need to connect a ZEBEDEE API Key to this new repl instance.

If you don’t yet have a [ZEBEDEE](https://dashboard.zebedee.io/) account, head on over to the [official how-to documentation](https://docs.zebedee.io/docs/dashboard/signup) or the [ZEBEDEE Developer Dashboard signup page](https://dashboard.zebedee.io/). Once you’ve got your account setup and verified, create a new Project and fetch its [LIVE API Key](https://docs.zebedee.io/docs/dashboard/projects/sandbox) from the dashboard (*important: it HAS to be a LIVE API Key, a SANDBOX API Key will not work*). It should look something like this:

<Frame caption="ZEBEDEE Developer Dashboard - Project API page">
  <img src="/img/docs/replit-quickstart/dev-dashboard.jpeg" alt="ZEBEDEE Developer Dashboard - Project API page" />
</Frame>

Now to place the ZEBEDEE API Key securely in the Replit dashboard, search for the **Secrets** tool on the sidebar:

<Frame caption="Replit Secrets UI">
  <img src="/img/docs/replit-quickstart/replit-secrets-ui.jpeg" alt="Replit Secrets UI" />
</Frame>

Click to **NEW SECRET** and name it **ZEBEDEE_API_KEY** and paste the key you copied from the ZEBEDEE Developer Dashboard.

<Frame caption="Replit Secrets UI">
  <img src="/img/docs/replit-quickstart/replit-secrets-ui-2.png" alt="Replit Secrets UI" />
</Frame>

That’s it! You’re all set.

Now press the big green **RUN** button on the top of the Replit page and you should see a new Webview module pop up with the template’s frontend loaded.

</Frame>

You can now head on over to your repl’s web url, mine is: [https://zebedee-nextjs-dev-playground.andrerfneves.repl.co](https://zebedee-nextjs-dev-playground.andrerfneves.repl.co/), and you should see your newly deployed ZEBEDEE-powered application!

The bottom 4 navigation item links take you to other ZEBEDEE API and ZEBEDEE Developer Dashboard learning resources. You can also find detailed [documentation about the @zbd/node Node.js SDK](https://zbd-node.dev.zebedee.cloud/). Lastly, there are guides on how to best deploy this starter kit to services like Vercel and Replit (this guide!).

At the top right of the web app you will find the **OPEN PLAYGROUND** link. Clicking that will take you to the *ZEBEDEE + Next.js Dev Playground* page which contains modules for the main use-cases of the ZEBEDEE API — Payments and Payment Requests (Charges), Lightning Address Payouts, Withdrawal QR codes, BTCUSD price ticker and much more.

</Frame>

On the top right you can see the *ZBD Project Wallet* detailing the balance of Bitcoin (in satoshis) available to this ZEBEDEE API Project key.

Each module is self-contained, which means you can just fill in each of the form elements and hit Submit to watch the magic happen. Results will appear inline.

**You can now literally send Bitcoin instantly anywhere in the world! No big deal.**

Here’s a Bitcoin Lightning Network payment request QR code I created by filling in the two input fields and hitting 1 button click.

</Frame>

Here I am sending a Bitcoin payment that’s settling instantaneously through the Lightning Network — this time sent to a [Lightning Address](https://lightningaddress.com/) (e.g. andre@zbd.gg).

The template is meant to serve as both a set of example source code files for developers to learn and get ideas from, as well as a full-blown backend + frontend app development environment. Because it is based on the Next.js framework, developers can get started editing code directly on the template’s JavaScript files and watch their changes reflect live on the accompanying Webview.

### Now, Go Build!

The goal with writing this guide and the ZEBEDEE Next.js Template starter kit for Replit is to simplify the process and reduce the steps necessary for app developers to build global instant payments into the fabric of their games, apps, and virtual user experiences.

[ZEBEDEE](https://zebedee.io/) is here to support you on your journey.

The future is waiting. Go build it!

### Troubleshooting

If you start your repl and it provides a message like the one below, it means you have not properly configured the **ZEBEDEE_API_KEY** in your Replit project’s Secrets.
