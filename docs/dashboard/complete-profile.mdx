Make sure you're leveraging all that ZEBEDEE has to offer by completing your profile! Completing your profile will allow you to take advantage of higher wallet limits, and will also allow you to attain LIVE production API keys.

Below are the many steps you can take to complete your profile.

## Verify Email Address[​](#verify-email-address "Direct link to heading")

During the registration flow we have already done this part, but users in ZEBEDEE Developer Dashboard can further complete their profile by verifying their email addresses.

## Pick ZBD Gamertag[​](#pick-zbd-gamertag "Direct link to heading")

All ZBD users have a ZBD Gamertag associated with their account, even Developers! It is important to select a concise and descriptive Gamertag, as this will appear in all push notifications that users receive if you send them funds.

Think of this as a username for your account. You can change your Gamertag at any time by following the steps in the **Account > Profile** sections.

<Tip>Did you know that creating a Developer account also creates a [**ZBD**](https://zbd.gg) App account?

You can use the same login information for your [ZEBEDEE Developer Dashboard](https://dashboard.zebedee.io) account on the ZBD App. Although the ZBD Gamertag is shared between these accounts, each has a separate Bitcoin wallet for fund segregation!</Tip>

## Upload Profile Image[​](#upload-profile-image "Direct link to heading")

You may add a profile image to your ZEBEDEE Developer account.

## Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)[​](#enable-two-factor-authentication-2fa "Direct link to heading")

Enabling Two-Factor is **highly recommended** to secure your account. You can do this from going to **Account > Security**. 2FA deters potential attackers from accessing your account by requiring a second factor of authentication.

## Verify Identity[​](#verify-identity "Direct link to heading")

In order to attain LIVE production API keys, you must verify your identity with ZEBEDEE such that we can compliantly process global payments on your behalf. This is a simple process that requires you to upload a photo of your ID alongside a quick selfie.

Verifying your identity will also increase your wallet limits.

## Change Password[​](#change-password "Direct link to heading")
