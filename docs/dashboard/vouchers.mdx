A ZBD Voucher is a single-time use coupon that can be redeemed by another ZBD user to transfer funds from your Developer Wallet into their wallet.

## Voucher Use Cases

You can create Vouchers anytime you want to send another ZBD user sats from your Developer Wallet.

Examples:

*   You want to gift a user but don’t know their ZBD Gamertag or Lightning Address
*   You want to send a Voucher to a user’s email to re-engage them
*   You want to run a promotion where you generate 100 Vouchers and give them away to people

## Create Voucher

To create Vouchers, go to the `Vouchers` page in the Dev Dashboard and click `Create Voucher`. When you create a Voucher, it debits the funds from your Developer Wallet. Alternatively, you can use the [Create Voucher](/api-reference/vouchers/create) API endpoint.

## Redeem Voucher

Vouchers are redeemed by entering the unique 8-digit code within the Dev Dashboard or Mobile App, or using the [Redeem Voucher](/api-reference/vouchers/redeem) API endpoint. The funds from the Voucher will be credited to your wallet balance. 

Dev Dashboard users can redeem Vouchers by pressing `z` + `m`, entering the 8-digit code, then pressing `Redeem Voucher`. This will credit the sats to your Developer wallet. 

ZBD Mobile App users can redeem Vouchers by following these steps:
1. Tap your wallet balance in the navbar to open your Wallet details
2. Press `Vouchers`
3. Press `Redeem`
4. Enter the Voucher Code
5. Press `Redeem Voucher`

## Share Voucher

The unique 8-digit code from a Voucher can be shared with another ZBD user, who can redeem it to transfer the funds from your wallet to their own.

## View Created Vouchers

There are multiple options to view Vouchers:

1. Navigate to the `Vouchers` page within the [Dev Dashboard](https://dashboard.zebedee.io/) to view a list of your Vouchers created via the Dev Dashboard UI.

## Revoke a Voucher

If you issue a Voucher, but want to revoke (cancel) it, you can:

1.  Revoke it via the [Revoke Voucher](/api-reference/vouchers/revoke) API endpoint
