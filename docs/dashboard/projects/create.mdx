Projects are the gateway into using the [ZBD API](/api-reference/introduction). Each project comes with a unique API key and a Bitcoin Lightning wallet. With this API key, you can receive funds, make payments, and withdraw Bitcoin â€” the API makes it possible to handle everything programmatically.

## 1 - Navigate to Projects 

If you're not already there, navigate to the `Projects` page in the sidebar menu, or use the keyboard shortcut `a + g`.

## 2 - Create new Project

Click the `Create Project` button in the middle of the page, or the `+` button in the top right of the page to open up the Create Project modal.

## 3 - Enter Project details

Complete the fields in the modal. The Project Name and Project Description fields are required, while the Project Image is highly recommended.

<Tip>Your _Project Name_ and _Project Image_ will appear in the ZBD App when you make a payment to a ZBD Username. The image needs to be square and less than 3 MB to upload and display properly.</Tip>  

## 4 - Submit

Now, click `Create Project` -- you will be redirected to the Project's Wallet tab once its successfully created.

_As you'd expect, the balances are all 0 given we just created this Project._
