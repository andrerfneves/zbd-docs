title: 'Create Project'

Projects are the gateway into using the [ZBD API](/knowledge-base/zbd-api/overview). Each project comes with a unique API key and a Bitcoin Lightning wallet. With this API key, you can receive funds, make payments, and withdraw Bitcoin â€” the API makes it possible to handle everything programmatically.

1.  If you're not already there, navigate to the `Projects` page in the sidebar menu, or use the keyboard shortcut `a + g`.

2.  Click the `Create Project` button in the middle of the page, or the `+` button in the top right of the page to open up the Create Project modal.

3.  Complete the fields in the modal. The Project Name and Project Description fields are required, while the Project Image is highly recommended.

<Tip>Your _Project Name_ and _Project Image_ will appear in the ZBD App when you make a payment to a ZBD Gamertag. The image needs to be square and less than 3 MB to upload and display properly.</Tip>  

4.  Now, click `Create Project` -- you will be redirected to the Project's Wallet tab once its successfully created.

_As you'd expect, the balances are all 0 given we just created this Project._

**Success! You've just created your first ZBD Project.**
