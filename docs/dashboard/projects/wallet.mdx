title: 'Project Wallets'

If you don't have a Project yet, [create one!](/docs/dashboard/projects/create)

The Wallet tab of your Project displays your wallet balance, transaction count, and transaction history.

*   Wallet balance: The amount of Bitcoin you hold in this wallet
*   Transaction count: The number of transactions you have made in the past 30 days
*   Transaction history: The record of all transactions made from this Project wallet

Each `Project` wallet is a distinct and fully-enabled Bitcoin Lightning wallet, meaning you can facilitate payments into and out of this wallet to interact with the Bitcoin Lightning Network.

Any payments made using this Projectâ€™s API key will debit this Project wallet. You can easily transfer funds from one project wallet to another.

<Tip>**Project wallets are distinct from your Developer wallet.** Your developer wallet is associated with your profile, while project wallets are generated whenever you create a new project.

Your Developer wallet is akin to a central management account and the project wallet as being an individual app account.</Tip>  

Fund a Project Wallet by:

1.  Creating a Charge via API and paying it; or
2.  Transferring funds from another Project or your Developer wallet (via UI or API)
