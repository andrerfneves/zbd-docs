The `Wallet` tab available inside of your Project view in the ZBD Dev Dashboard is where you will find all information about movement of money through this Project.

The Project Wallet is a Bitcoin Lightning wallet that is generated for each Project you create. This Wallet is used to facilitate payments into and out of this Project to the Bitcoin Lightning Network.


## Wallet Tab Data

Data points available in the Wallet tab include:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Wallet Balance" icon="bitcoin" color="#ff9900">
    The amount of Bitcoin you currently hold in this Project Wallet.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Transaction count" icon="bitcoin" color="#ff9900">
    The number of transactions from this Project Wallet in the past 30 days.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Transaction history" icon="bitcoin" color="#ff9900">
    The record of all transactions made from this Project Wallet.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Wallet Architecture

<Note>
Each Project Wallet is a distinct and fully-enabled Bitcoin Lightning wallet.
  
In short, **1 Project = 1 Wallet = 1 API Key**.  
</Note>

**Any payments made using this Project's API key will debit this Project Wallet.** Any Charges created by this Project Wallet that are paid successfully, will be credited to this account.

<Tip>
**Project Wallets are distinct from your ZBD Developer Wallet.**
  
Your Developer Wallet is associated with your user profile, while Project Wallets are created whenever you make a new Project.

Your Developer Wallet is akin to a `central management account` and the Project Wallet is an `individual app account`.
</Tip>

## Funding a Project Wallet

To fund a Project Wallet you can either:

- Transfer funds from one Project Wallet to another using the ZBD Dev Dashboard
- Use the Internal Transfer API endpoint
- Create a Charge (or Static Charge) and pay it
