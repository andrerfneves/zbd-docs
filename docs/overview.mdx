## What is ZBD?

ZBD is a global fintech focused on developing payments solutions on top of Bitcoin's [Lightning Network](/knowledge-base/lightning-network) rails. Our technology stack is vast and supports all kinds of applications: Game Developers, Fintechs, Social Platforms, and AdTechs.

Our Lightning Network-powered infrastructure enables secure and instant Bitcoin transactions, and allows for frictionless payments of any size at extremely low fees. We remove the compliance, regulatory, and technical lift associated with incorporating modern global payment infrastructure into the fabric of app.
