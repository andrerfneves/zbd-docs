The ZEBEDEE App has a built-in Bitcoin wallet that has support for sending and receiving Bitcoin in various ways. If you'd like to understand the limits of your ZEBEDEE App wallet and how to increase them, head on over to the `Wallet >> Limits` settings menu on the sidebar on the mobile app.

Below is a detailed list of the wallet limits and their values as a user increases its verification levels within the ZEBEDEE platform.

### Spending Limits[​](#spending-limits "Direct link to heading")

While this is not a requirement to receive funds, it is important to note that **users must verify email addresses in order to spend funds from their wallets**.

### Charge === Receive[​](#charge--receive "Direct link to heading")

If you are trying to receive funds from someone, most likely a `Charge` is being created (possibly behind the scenes) for the payer to pay you. If they're unable to send you that amount of funds, there's a chance YOUR ZEBEDEE App wallet's maximum charge size is not large enough. To increase it follow the Verification Process in the ZEBEDEE App.
