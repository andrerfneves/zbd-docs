To send Bitcoin to a given Lightning Address, all you need to do is call the [Send Lightning Address Payment API](/api/lightning-address/send-payment) with a POST call providing the following properties:

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **lnAddress** | Recipient Lightning Address to send payment to. |
| **amount** | Total amount of satoshis to send (in millisatoshis). |
| **comment** | comment to be sent with the payment (max 150 characters). |

Example: If you wish to reward 20 satoshis to a user for their completion of a challenge, and you have the user's Lightning Address, you can use the information below to send it in 1 API call.

```json
{
  "amount": "20000",
  "lnAddress": "andre@zbd.gg",
  "comment": "Sending to a Lightning Address"
}
```

Response payloads will usually look similar to this:

```json

  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "id": "795de178-573f-47dd-9535-a710cd9daf56",

Wow that's easy. Welcome to instantaneous payments!

<Info>Fees are added post-send given that the routing fees for the Lightning Network are variable.(e.g if you send a 10,000 satoshi transaction to a Lightning Address and the fee ends up being 10 satoshis, the total paid by the API wallet is 10,010 satoshis).</Info>
