The ZEBEDEE API offers a robust RESTful API allowing for the quick integration of [Bitcoin Lightning Network](/docs/lightning-network) nanotransactions into any digital experience (e.g. apps, games, social platforms). ZEBEDEE API empowers apps and platforms with the ability to send and receive Bitcoin nearly instantaneously at practically zero-cost.

Our API aims to provide developers an easy path to integrating Bitcoin by abstracting _any and all_ of the complexities of the underlying system (think: no blockchains, no liquidity management, no infrastructure concerns -> just an API away).

The ZEBEDEE API exposes a REST interface with endpoints that return JSON responses. Partners integrating with ZEBEDEE API get access to the [ZEBEDEE Developer Dashboard](https://dashboard.zebedee.io) where they can manage their Projects and retrieve unique API Keys for authenticating the API.

# API Reference

All ZEBEDEE API endpoints are documented on the [API Reference](/api/intro). This reference guide is a detailed technical document explaining each of the endpoints available in the ZEBEDEE API.

<Tip>The API Reference also boasts a right-sidebar [API Module](/api/charges/create) which allows you to interact with the ZEBEDEE API directly from the browser with the click of a button.</Tip>
