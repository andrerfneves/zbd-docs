The ZEZBDBEDEE API follows standard HTTP response codes for handling success and error requests. If you are unfamiliar with HTTP requests, [please read more here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status).

<Note>HTTP response status codes indicate whether a specific HTTP request has been successfully completed.</Note>  

# HTTP Status Codes

Below is an overview of HTTP status codes available in the standard, which ZBD API adheres by:

| HTTP Response Group | Status Code Range |
| --- | :-: |
| Informational Responses | 100-199 |
| **Successful Responses** | 200-299 |
| Redirects | 300-399 |
| **Client Errors** | 400-499 |
| **Server Errors** | 500-599 |

  

# ZBD API Status Codes

As seen above, you are most likely to encounter the highlighted HTTP status codes ranges when interacting with the ZBD API. More details with the specific meaning of the status codes follow below:

| Status Code | Details | Response Description |

## Error Messages[â€‹](#error-messages "Direct link to heading")

To help identify the issue with your API requests, the error JSON response returned will include a **message** property that aims to be descriptive. Follow the details from the message, alongside the [API Reference](/api/intro) / [Documentation](/docs/quick-start) to resolve the issue.

Example of an error message from the API:

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "Error creating Withdrawal Request: The \"amount\" property (in millisatoshis) is required.",
}
```
