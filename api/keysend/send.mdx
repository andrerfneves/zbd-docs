title: "Send Keysend Payment"
api: "POST https://api.zebedee.io/v0/keysend-payment"
---

## Description

Every Lightning Network node has a Public Key identifying it to the wider network. While most payments in the Lightning Network require Payment Requests ([Charges](/docs/glossary#charges)) QR codes to be created and then paid for, there is another type of payment known as `Spontaneous Payment` or `Keysend Payment` on a more technical note.

This endpoint exposes the ability to make payment directly to a Lightning Network node Public Key, without the need for a Payment Request / Charge.

## Usage

If your system relies on sending Bitcoin over the Lightning Network to specific node Public Keys, this API is what you're looking for.

Additional metadata and TLV record data can be attached to this endpoint as well. Both of these properties/values will be returned on the `callbackUrl` POST call from ZEBEDEE.

As with all asynchronous payments in the Lightning Network, in order to receive updates about whether a payment settled, you must provide the `callbackUrl` property. As you will note from the response example below, if the Keysend Payment doesn't settle (almost) immediately, you will receive a `Payment Processing` response payload. Once it settles, you'll receive the update on the `callbackUrl`.
