In this video Souleima creates a very simple and utterly insecure game. Even though there have been occurrences of developers developing games in such a way, this is overly insecure by design.

The point of this video is to make sure the developer is 100% aware that the development methods shown in the video are indeed **INSECURE** and should not be used outside demo environments.
