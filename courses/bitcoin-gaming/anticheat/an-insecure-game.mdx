title: 'An Insecure Game'
description: 'In this video Souleima creates a very simple but utterly insecure game. Even though there have been occurrences of developers developing a game in such a way it is overly insecure. The point of this video is to make sure the developer is 100% aware that the development methods shown in the video are INSECURE and should not be used.'
