title: 'Making A More Secure Game'
description: 'In this video Souleima shows how as a developer you should move as much of the game as possible to the server inorder to make it more secure and mitigate the attacks shown above. '

Souleima shows how this can be done with “Playfab” however other options such as Beamable or the developers own server can be used.The main takeaway of this video is that the developer should not use the ZEBEDEE api directly in their game and should make calls from a server. Furthermore the ZEBEDEE API Key should NEVER be stored in the client.
