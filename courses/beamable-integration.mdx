## Why use [Beamable](https://beamable.com/?referral=zbd) with ZBD?

To ensure the security of your game integration with the [ZBD API](/api-reference/introduction), it is _crucial_ to safeguard your [ZBD API Key](/docs/dashboard/projects/api) and avoid exposing it within any client-side code. 

By leveraging [Beamable](https://beamable.com/?referral=zbd)'s Microservices and Realm (environment) configurations, you can secure your ZBD API Key by moving it from the game client to a server.

> A microservice architecture, or "microservice", is a solution of developing software systems that focuses on building single-function modules with well-defined interfaces and operations.

## [Beamable](https://beamable.com/?referral=zbd) Setup

### 1. Obtain ZBD API Key

To interact with the [ZBD API](/api-reference/introduction), you must obtain an [API Key](/docs/dashboard/projects/api) from your [ZBD Dev Dashboard](https://dashboard.zebedee.io/) account. If you are unsure about the process, see [this guide](/docs/dashboard/introduction) for step-by-step instructions.

### 2. Add ZBD API Key to your [Beamable](https://beamable.com/?referral=zbd) Project

You need to add the ZBD API Key to your project's Realm Configuration on Beamable. Please refer to [this guide](https://docs.beamable.com/docs/installing-beamable), which explains how to log in to [Beamable](https://beamable.com/?referral=zbd) and create a game. _If you are utilizing the ZBD / [Beamable](https://beamable.com/?referral=zbd) starter project, you can skip the installation steps and proceed directly to logging in and creating a game._

1. In the [Beamable](https://beamable.com/?referral=zbd) Portal in the left side menu go to `Operate` -> `Config`

2. Add a new config by clicking `+ Add Config`

<Frame>
  <img src="/img/v2/guides/beamable/beamable-realm-config.png" alt="Add config to realm" />
</Frame>

3. Add two Config Values:

| Namespace: | Key: | Value: | Notes: |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ZebedeeAPI | clientsecret | your client secret | This is only needed for the ZBD Login Example |
| ZebedeeAPI | apikey | your API Key | This is needed for any interaction with the ZBD API |

## Run Microservices Locally

By leveraging Microservices, we are securing our ZBD API Key by moving it from the game client to a server.

Before testing the Microservices, we need to run it locally.

### 1. Open Microservices Manager

In Unity, go to `Window` -> `Beamable` ->  `Open Microservices Manager`

<Frame>
  <img src="/img/v2/guides/beamable/beamable-toolbox.png" alt="Open Microservices manager window" />
</Frame>

💡 **Note:** Here you will see the `ZebedeeMicroservice`

<Frame>
  <img src="/img/v2/guides/beamable/beamable-microservice-manager.png" alt="ZBD Microservice in Unity" />
</Frame>

💡 **Note:** If you see this warning, make sure you have Docker installed.
<Frame>
 <img src="/img/v2/guides/beamable/beamable-docker.png" width="500" alt="Docker warning" />
</Frame>

### 2. Run Microservice

Hit the `Play` button.

---

## Publish Microservices on [Beamable](https://beamable.com/?referral=zbd) Platform

When you are ready to test on other devices (outside of Unity editor), you will need to publish your Microservice to [Beamable](https://beamable.com/?referral=zbd).

### 1. Open [Beamable](https://beamable.com/?referral=zbd) Publish Window

In the `Microservices Manager` tab in Unity, click `Publish`.

<Frame>
  <img src="/img/v2/guides/beamable/beamable-publish.png" alt="Publish window in Unity" />
</Frame>

### 2. Publish Select Microservices

In the `Publish` window, toggle on which Microservice(s) you want published, then click `Publish`. This will deploy your Microservice(s) to [Beamable](https://beamable.com/?referral=zbd)'s platform.

<Frame>
  <img src="/img/v2/guides/beamable/beamable-deploy.png" alt="Publishing the Microservice" />
</Frame>

### 3. View Microservices Status

Validate the applicable Microservice(s) are running by viewing the `Microservices` tab in the [Beamable](https://beamable.com/?referral=zbd) Portal.

<Frame>
  <img src="/img/v2/guides/beamable/beamable-running.png" alt="Beamable Portal Microservice overview" />
</Frame>

💡 For more details on publishing Microservices, check out the [Beamable](https://beamable.com/?referral=zbd) documentation [here](https://docs.beamable.com/docs/microservices-distributing).

At this point, your game can now connect the published Beamable Microservice(s), which protects your ZBD API Key from the game client!

---

## Integrating the Microservices

To see sample code for how to integrate [Beamable](https://beamable.com/?referral=zbd) Microservices, view the `MyController.cs` file in the scripts directory of the ZBD Unity Package within Unity. Insert this code in applicable area(s) of your game; e.g. when you're [Sending sats to a ZBD Gamertag](/api-reference/zbd-gamertag/send).

To get data that needs to be secure from [Beamable](https://beamable.com/?referral=zbd) (as we do for the `apikey` and `clientsecret`), you can reference the code in `Config.cs` and the `GetAPIKey` function in `ZebedeeMicroservice.cs`.

```csharp
// This code ensures that the Beamable Microservice is ready
var ctx = BeamContext.Default;
await ctx.OnReady;

// This line makes the call to the Microservice
var result = await ctx.Microservices().ZebedeeMicroservice().GetWallet();

// Here we take the string and convert it to a response object
// The ZBD sdk has a response object for all responses.
// This allows you to easily get the data you need.
var jsonObject = JsonConvert.DeserializeObject<GetWalletDetails_Response>(result);

// If needed for custom Microservice integration...
// This code gets the value stored at the given key from Beamable
public string ApiKey => _settings.GetSetting("ZebedeeAPI", "apikey");
public string ClientSecret => _settings.GetSetting("ZebedeeAPI", "clientsecret");
```

## ZBD Login Example Scene

This scene shows how you can integrate [ZBD Login](/docs/zbd-login/introduction) with an Android build.

This uses the Microservice to communicate with ZBD to let your users log in securely.

To see how to integrate ZBD Login (OAuth2 flow) you can check out the `LoginController.cs` script. This handles the initial start of the login flow and the deep link functionality.

### 1. Get ZBD OAuth2 Client ID

Add your [Client ID](/docs/zbd-login/integration) from the [ZBD Dev Dashboard](https://dashboard.zebedee.io/) and add it to the `LoginController` in the ZBD Login demo scene.

<Frame>
  <img src="/img/v2/guides/beamable/beamable-clientid.png" alt="Add client ID to demo scene" />
</Frame>

### 2. Ensure Microservices are Published

If you haven't already, you will need to publish your Microservice(s) to [Beamable](https://beamable.com/?referral=zbd). Once your Microservice(s) are published, you will be able to use it from anywhere. See [Publish Select Microservices](#2-publish-select-microservices) for more details. 

### 3. Build for Android 

You can now build your game for Android. Learn more [here](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/android-BuildProcess.html).
