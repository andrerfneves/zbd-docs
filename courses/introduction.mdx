## Educational Resources

ZBD provides an extensive array of educational resources, including tutorials, walkthroughs, and guides. These resources are available in both the [Knowledge Base](/knowledge-base) and [Documentation](/docs) sections of [zbd.dev](https://zbd.dev).

This Courses section is designed for learners seeking a more in-depth understanding. It offers a systematic, step-by-step approach to learning specific topics within the broader development ecosystem of the ZBD API.

We invite you to join our range of video-led courses, which aim to impart knowledge on various topics such as Bitcoin, Lightning, LNURL, Nostr, and even the basics of Web Development.
