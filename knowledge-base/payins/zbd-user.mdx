## ZBD Username Charge API

While you can use the [Send Bitcoin to ZBD Username](/api-reference/zbd-user/send) endpoint to make a direct payment to a ZBD user, if you want to create a regular Lightning Network payment request / Charge QR code for that given user, you can do so using the [Create Charge for ZBD Username](/api-reference/zbd-user/create) endpoint.

In order to request Charges from a ZBD Username you just need to make a simple API call with a payload like the example below.

```bash
curl --location --request POST 'https://api.zebedee.io/v0/gamertag/charges' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'apikey: API_KEY_HERE' \
--data-raw '{
    "gamertag": "andre",
    "amount": "15000",
    "internalId": "12347ahk1n",
    "description": "ZBD so fast!",
    "callbackUrl": "https://your-app.com/zbd-callback"
}'
```

In order to receive updates about the status of this request, make sure to include a `callbackUrl` in the `data` portion of the request.

The response payload will include a **`invoiceRequest`** which is the contents of the payment request QR code.

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "status": "CHARGE_PENDING",
    "amount": "15000",
    "internalId": "12347ahk1n",
    "description": "ZBD so fast!",
    "invoiceRequest": "lnbc100n1pskq45xpp5q5rtpfzydndqk4fu2y4h64fdc284y6av0fn8gz4dmkq89xuxd28sdpvw3jhxarfdenjqctxw3jhygrjv4kk7anfdenjqmnpd4jscqzpgxqzjcsp59g6vgrss790zkwjqc3adndzt5tcq2ltaxynfstggjl6rre3kk6js9qyyssqfyan62pzsjsm62l6zq57jv9pmlpmycvqu649ccfjn7mar77awgykz2gft3fcgl9x5m4mz78nyng920uf6zwft5qnt2qjtqgpl7c72dgq4z7mgv",
    "invoiceExpiresAt": "2021-10-08T14:42:38.759Z",
    "unit": "msats",
    "createdAt": "2022-02-08T14:32:38.793Z"
  },
  "message": "Successfully created charge request for gamertag"
}
```

<Info>Charges / Payment Requests have defined expiration times. After a Charge expires it cannot be paid, but you can simply create another one.</Info>

Once a payment is made and the Charge settles, the ZBD User will receive a Push Notification alerting them they've been sent some Bitcoin.

## Multiplayer Commerce through ZBD Username Charges

For App or Game Developers that wish to provide a more robust commerce experience for their users and gamers, requesting an invoice from ZBD Usernames can be one of the ways.

**Think of yourself, the Developer, as the Orchestrator of payments.**

By leveraging Lightning Network invoices tied to specific ZBD Username, you can ensure that the payment is made to the correct user, and that the payment has truly settled.

### 1. Two-Step Payment Orchestration

Let's say **Alice** wants to buy a sword from **Bob** inside of the game. Well that's easy, and there's two ways:

### 2. ZBD Username Charges

You can use the above endpoint to create a Charge from **Bob**'s ZBD Username, and display it for **Alice** to pay. Pass a `callbackUrl` on the ZBD API request and when the payment settles, you will be alerted of it and can then transfer the sword asset inside the game.

**Yes, it's really that simple!**

### 3. Project Wallet as Escrow

Alternatively you could rely on the Project's own Wallet as a form of escrow. You can create a Charge using the `/charges` endpoint passing a `callbackUrl` to receive settlement updates, and have **Alice** pay it.

<Info>Alice will effectively be paying the Project Wallet in this scenario.</Info>

Once payment is settled, you can use the [Send Bitcoin to ZBD Username](/api-reference/zbd-user/send) endpoint and send the same amount to **Bob**. When this second payment settles you can then transfer the sword asset inside the game.

While this technically involves two transactions, it provides a bit more control to the Developer that wishes to manage the transfer of assets/in-game items a bit more closely and with more checks and balances in place. Both approaches are recommended.
