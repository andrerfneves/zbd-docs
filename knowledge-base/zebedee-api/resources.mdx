## Utility APIs[​](#utility-apis "Direct link to heading")

When integrating ZBD API for payments capabilities in your system, it's important to have utility data points / functionalities available.

We've made a set of these Utility APIs available in the API Reference:

*   [BTC USD Exchange Rate](/api-reference/utils/btc-usd) -> Fetches the latest price for 1 Bitcoin in USD
*   [Is Supported Region](/api-reference/utils/is-supported-region) -> Fetches whether a user is located in a region ZBD services are available
*   [ZBD Production IPs](/api-reference/utils/api) -> Fetches the static IP addresses for ZBD servers

## External Resources[​](#external-resources "Direct link to heading")

While the ZBD API abstracts away all of the complexity around the Bitcoin and Lightning Network protocols, it is important to have handy a list of tools, websites, and resources for those wanting to learn more or dive deeper.

This is not an exhaustive list, simply an opinionated set of toolkit and resources that we find useful for partner developers:

#### **[Lightning Decoder](https://lightningdecoder.com)**[​](#lightning-decoder "Direct link to heading")

This tool will decode all kinds of Bitcoin Lightning Network QR codes, including Charges, Withdrawal Requests and Lightning Addresses, and then displays the decoded information in an easy to understand manner.

#### **[Lightning Address](https://lightningaddress.com)**[​](#lightning-address "Direct link to heading")

Home of the Lightning Address protocol (protol for internet identifier for Lightning payments - [satoshi@zbd.gg](mailto:satoshi@zbd.gg)). Like an email address, but for your Bitcoin.

#### **[LNURL Documents](https://github.com/lnurl/luds)**[​](#lnurl-documents "Direct link to heading")

Code repository hosting all of the open-source LNURL protocol specifications.

#### **[bolt11.org](https://bolt11.org)**[​](#bolt11org "Direct link to heading")

Visual overview of the BOLT11 payment request specification. If you're trying to understand more about how a Lightning invoice works, this is your place.
