title: 'Authentication'
---

The [ZBD API](/api-reference/introduction) uses API Keys to authenticate requests. Each of your Projects in the [ZBD Dev Dashboard](https://dashboard.zebedee.io) will have an unique API Key that allows for the management and control over that Project's Wallet.

[Check this guide](/docs/dashboard/projects/api) to find your unique `API_KEY`, or to regenerate the API Key for a specific Project.

# Authenticating Requests

Authentication to the API is **required** for all endpoints provided, and is performed by passing the Project's API Key as the `apikey` HTTP request header property.

| Request Header | Value |
| --- | :-: |
| `apikey` | `API_KEY` |

  
<Note>Any requests that do not feature a valid `apikey` header property in the request will be rejected.</Note>  

# SSL / HTTPS Access

The ZBD API only provides a secure interface over HTTPS with SSL certificate support. Any requests that attempt to reach the ZBD API in an insecure fashion (plain-text over HTTP requests) will be rejected.

<Note>Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) is the standard security technology for establishing an encrypted link between a server and a client. SSL allows sensitive information such as credit card numbers, social security numbers, and login credentials to be transmitted securely.</Note>
