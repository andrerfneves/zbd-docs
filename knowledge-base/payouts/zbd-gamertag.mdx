## Introduction[​](#introduction "Direct link to heading")

The ZBD API allows for Partner to create Charges, perform Payments, and process Withdrawal Requests for any user, wallet, or service that understands / speaks the Lightning Network protocol. These capabilities are possible because of the underlying `Lightning Charges / Payment Requests / Invoices`, the single-use payable QR codes the platform can create and handle.

While this Payment Request provides a truly interoperable experience for ZBD-powered applications, games, and services to interact with any type of Bitcoin Lightning wallet a user may use, it can at times provide for a much poorer user experience (UX). This is the case because it involves a switch of context, going in-and-out of the app / game and wallet applications to perform a simple payment or withdrawal. This is especially true for mobile devices (which comprises over 2/3 of the entire gaming market for example).

## Enter the ZBD Gamertag[​](#enter-the-zbd-gamertag "Direct link to heading")

**Every ZBD user has a ZBD Gamertag.** A ZBD Gamertag is a user's unique identifier that allows a Partner to directly interact with the given user. This means you can directly send payments to users / gamers.

### Send Bitcoin to ZBD Gamertag[​](#send-bitcoin-to-zbd-gamertag "Direct link to heading")

In order to send payments directly to a user's Gamertag you just need to make an API call simple API call with a payload similar to the example below.

| Property | Status | Description |
| --- | :-: | :-: |
| Endpoint | [`/gamertag/send-payment`](/api-reference/gamertag/send) | API endpoint to use. |
| HTTP Method | `POST` | The type of HTTP request to invoke. |
| Authentication | `apikey` | How the API request is authenticated by ZBD Platform. |

For the `data` portion of the POST request, you can use the following payload as an example:

```json
{
  "gamertag": "andre", // the user's ZBD Gamertag
  "amount": "15000", // the amount of millisatoshis to send
  "description": "So fast!" // This appears on the transaction details in the user's ZBD app
}
```

If the ZBD Gamertag exists and is active, the ZBD API will perform the transaction and will return a 200 status code and a JSON response with the following:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "status": "settled",
    "settledAt": "2021-10-08T14:21:55.378Z",
    "amount": "5000",
    "receiverId": "3dde8e48-7c13-4db7-a0e5-caf2a48c002a",
    "comment": "So fast!"
  },
  "message": "Payment done."
}
```

At this stage the user will receive a Push Notification alerting them they've been sent some Bitcoin.

## In-Game Bitcoin Rewards through ZBD Gamertag[​](#in-game-bitcoin-rewards-through-zbd-gamertag "Direct link to heading")

One of the many benefits of the ZBD API is that it is flexible enough to allow for developers to create simple in-game reward systems for their gamers. This is shown to increase user retention and improve general KPIs around ROAS and CPI. This is done by asking the user to enter their ZBD Gamertag in the game, and whenever the user completes a level, or triggers an event (depends entirely on the game and the developer's needs), some Bitcoin is immediately streamed to their ZBD App.
