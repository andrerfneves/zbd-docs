## Lightning Address API

To send Bitcoin to a given Lightning Address, all you need to do is call the [Send Lightning Address Payment API](/api-reference/lightning-address/send) with a POST call providing the following properties:

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `lnAddress` | Recipient Lightning Address to send payment to. |
| `amount` | Total amount of satoshis to send (in millisatoshis). |
| `comment` | comment to be sent with the payment (max 150 characters). |

<Info>Example: If you wish to reward 20 satoshis to a user for their completion of a challenge, and you have the user's Lightning Address, you can use the information below to send it in 1 API call.</Info>

## Sending Transaction

<CodeGroup>

```js NodeJS
// Using ZBD's NodeJS SDK
import { zbd } from '@zbd/node';

// Instantiate ZBD client
const ZBD = new zbd(API_KEY_HERE);

// Set the payload
const payload = {
  amount: "20000",
  lnAddress: "andre@zbd.gg",
  comment: "Sending to a Lightning Address"
};

// Send Lightning Address payment
try {
  const response = await ZBD.sendLightningAddressPayment(payload);
} catch(error) {
  console.log({ error });
}
```

```bash cURL
curl --location --request POST 'https://api.zebedee.io/v0/ln-address/send-payment' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'apikey: API_KEY_HERE' \
--data-raw '{
    "amount": "20000",
    "lnAddress": "andre@zbd.gg",
    "comment": "Sending to a Lightning Address"
}'
```

</CodeGroup>

## API Response

Response payloads will usually look similar to this:

```json

  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "id": "795de178-573f-47dd-9535-a710cd9daf56",

  },
  "message": "Payment done."
}
```

Wow that's easy. Welcome to instantaneous payments!

<Tip>Fees are added post-send given that the routing fees for the Lightning Network are variable.(e.g if you send a 10,000 satoshi transaction to a Lightning Address and the fee ends up being 10 satoshis, the total paid by the API wallet is 10,010 satoshis).</Tip>
