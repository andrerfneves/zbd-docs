## Send Bitcoin to Email API

To send Bitcoin to a given email, all you need to do is call the [Pay to Email API](/api-reference/email/send) with a POST call providing the following properties:

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `email` | Recipient email to send payment to. |
| `amount` | Total amount of satoshis to send (in millisatoshis). |
| `comment` | comment to be sent with the payment (max 150 characters). |

<Info>Example: If you wish to reward 20 satoshis to a user for their completion of a challenge, and you have the user's email, you can use the information below to send it in 1 API call.</Info>

## Details

- If the email is associated with an existing ZBD App account, then that user account will be credited the sats.
- Otherwise, the sats will be issued to the email in the form of a valid [ZBD Voucher](/docs/dashboard/vouchers) that the recipient can redeem in the [ZBD Mobile App](/docs/zbd-app/download). 

## API Response

Response payloads will look like this:

```

    "success": true,
    "data": {
        "amount": "1000",
        "code": "CB6A2DC5",
