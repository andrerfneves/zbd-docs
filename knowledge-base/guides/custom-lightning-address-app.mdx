You'll get this awesome landing page. You'll create a Static Charge QR code to receive money to as well as an internet identifier called Lightning Address to receive money to.

# Dependencies

You would need the following:

*   Access to the ZBD API.
    *   If you don’t have an account, register an account at [here](https://dashboard.zebedee.io/signup).
*   A basic understanding of programming.

# Static Charge & Lightning Address Explained

## Static Charge and Lightning Address Use Cases[​](#static-charge-and-lightning-address-use-cases "Direct link to heading")

Static Charges and Lightning Addresses are excellent for easily receiving payments. Static Charges can be set such that they can be used an unlimited number of times and they don’t expire. So it makes receiving payments easy.

You can get your own Lightning Address and Static Charge that is tied to your own username and domain.

## How does Static Charge Work?[​](#how-does-static-charge-work "Direct link to heading")

A static charge is actually a URL that is used to process incoming payment requests by returning an invoice to the app requesting to make a payment for a specific amount. The app will then take the invoice and pay it.

## Example QR[​](#example-qr "Direct link to heading")

## Example Lightning Address[​](#example-lightning-address "Direct link to heading")

`santos@zbd.gg` - it looks like an example but it’s used to receive money to. It could also be an email at the same time. Whoa~.

# How to Make your Project Return Lightning Address Static Charge Metadata using Django

In this tutorial we’ll setup a Django project that allows you to receive payment to your own lightning address.

⛔ **WARNING!** THIS WILL OVERWRITE ANY FILES YOU CURRENTLY HAVE FOR THE DOMAIN!

## Getting started[​](#getting-started "Direct link to heading")

### Install Python[​](#install-python "Direct link to heading")

If you already have python installed, skip this section.

You can download and install python [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3113/). Select your relevant operating system and install.

### Install VS Code[​](#install-vs-code "Direct link to heading")

If you already have a code editor installed, skip this section.

This application is a Code Editor that will make it much easier to manage your code. Install it [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

To get started quickly, you can clone the repository where most things are already setup.

## Getting the Codebase and Installing Requirements[​](#getting-the-codebase-and-installing-requirements "Direct link to heading")

In your terminal in VS Code, clone the following repository by running this command:

`git clone https://github.com/zantoshi/lightning-address-app`

Next, install the requirements by running the following command:

`cd lightning-address-app && pip install -r requirements.txt`

If you get an error try running:

`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

## Plug and Play[​](#plug-and-play "Direct link to heading")

Now that you have the codebase setup and the requirements installed, let’s connect your Dev Dashboard account.

Create a `.env` file with the following config.

```env
ZEBEDEE_API_KEY="API_KEY_GOES_HERE"
LIGHTNING_ADDRESS="YOUR_LIGHTNING_ADDRESS_HERE"
MY_DOMAIN="DOMAIN.com"
STATIC_CHARGE_ID="YOUR_STATIC_CHARGE_ID_FROM_ZEBEDEE_HERE"
STATIC_CHARGE="INPUT_URI_HERE"
SECRET_KEY="YOUR_SECRET_KEY_HERE"
```

We will be updating this throughout the tutorial.

## Creating a Static Charge[​](#creating-a-static-charge "Direct link to heading")

The ZBD API makes static charge creation very easy. Here is a high-level example of the URL, payload, and the response from the API.

Using the ZBD Doc Portal, send a POST Request to the following URL with the payload beneath it after plugging in your API key.

⭐ Be sure to determine what you want your lightning address to be and update it in the the identifier field. Mine will be `sats@santos.lol`.

Navigate to the Doc Portal. Add this to your payload AFTER changing the `identifier` , `description` , `identifier`, and `succesMessage.`

<Frame type="glass" caption="">
  <img src="/img/guides/1.png" alt="Screenshot 1" />
</Frame>
<br />

```json
{
  "identifier": "sats@santos.lol",
  "description": "This is my Static Charge and Lightning Address.",
  "successMessage": "Thank you for supporting me!",
  "allowedSlots": null,
  "minAmount": "1000",
  "maxAmount": "100000000"
}
```

Paste it in the code box.

**MAKE SURE TO UPDATE THE PARAMETERS OTHERWISE YOUR LIGHTNING ADDRESS WON’T WORK!**

<Frame type="glass" caption="">
  <img src="/img/guides/2.png" alt="Screenshot 2" />
</Frame>
<br />

Add your `apikey.`

<Frame type="glass" caption="">
  <img src="/img/guides/3.png" alt="Screenshot 3" />
</Frame>
<br />

<Frame type="glass" caption="">
  <img src="/img/guides/4.png" alt="Screenshot 4" />
</Frame>
<br />

You should get a response that looks something like this.

```json
{
  "message": "Successfully created Static Charge.",
  "data": {
    "id": "d94e7893-5a1a-4ef9-b2c2-e549fc6b1e0e",
    "unit": "msats",
    "slots": 0,
    "minAmount": "10000",
    "maxAmount": "100000000",
    "identifier": "sats@santos.lol",
    "createdAt": "2023-05-14T20:55:36.259Z",
    "expiresAt": null,
    "internalId": null,
    "description": "This is my Static Charge and Lightning Address.",
    "callbackUrl": null,
    "allowedSlots": null,
    "successMessage": "Thank you for supporting me!",
    "status": "active",
    "invoice": {
      "request": "lnurl1dp68gurn8ghj7ctsdyh85etzv4jx2efwd9hj7a3s9aex2ut4v4ehgttnw3shg6tr943ksctjvajhxtmy8y6x2dec8yej6dtpx9sj6dr9vcuj6c3jvvez6ef4xsukvcekvgck2vr9ppvamy",
      "uri": "lightning:lnurl1dp68gurn8ghj7ctsdyh85etzv4jx2efwd9hj7a3s9aex2ut4v4ehgttnw3shg6tr943ksctjvajhxtmy8y6x2dec8yej6dtpx9sj6dr9vcuj6c3jvvez6ef4xsukvcekvgck2vr9ppvamy"
    }
  }
}
```

After sending your POST request, you should receive the following back as a response. You’ll want to save the `id` that you get back. We’ll use this to support your own Lightning Address.

You can also `save` the `data.invoice.uri` field so that you can turn it into a QR code.

`lightning:lnurl1dp68gurn8ghj7ctsdyh85etzv4jx2efwd9hj7a3s9aex2ut4v4ehgttnw3shg6tr943ksctjvajhxte5x43nyv34vgcj6vpjxf3z6drpxvmj6wfcvsmz6dtpx56nvwrxxuuxgvf3uzvpfy`

Now each time that you receive payments to your Lightning Address, your ZBD project will get balance increases.

**Update your .env file with the ID and the URI.**

## Creating a Secret Key for Django[​](#creating-a-secret-key-for-django "Direct link to heading")

Run the following command in your terminal.

`python -c 'from django.core.management.utils import get_random_secret_key; print(get_random_secret_key())'`

**Copy the output and update your .env file with the output for SECRET\_KEY.**

# Deploying your app to Namecheap

If you don’t have a domain and hosting already, you can sign-up for one at [namecheap.com](https://namecheap.com). Once you have a domain and hosting, you can proceed.

**Note: I am going to assume that you have purchased your domain and have cPanel hosting.**

**Update your .env file with your own domain. It must be without http, https, or www. For example, my domain is `santos.lol` therefore I use that.**

## Create Python App[​](#create-python-app "Direct link to heading")

Log into your cPanel account. Search for or select `Setup Python App` .

## Connecting via FTP to Upload your App[​](#connecting-via-ftp-to-upload-your-app "Direct link to heading")

Download FileZilla [here](https://filezilla-project.org/), which is a File Transfer Protocol client. If you already have an FTP client. Please feel to proceed.

Once you have an FTP client such as FileZilla, you’ll want to connect your hosting provider.

Update your **Host** by entering `ftp.YOURDOMAIN.com`.

For your username, enter your namecheap cpanel username.

*   **Enter the password associated with your cpanel account.**

Hit quick connect.

<Frame type="glass" caption="">
  <img src="/img/guides/10.png" alt="Screenshot 10" />
</Frame>
<br />

Once you’ve done that, look for your domain name and double click the folder. Now you’ll want to copy the files in `lightning-address-app` folder and drop them into the folder.

<Frame type="glass" caption="">
  <img src="/img/guides/11.png" alt="Screenshot 11" />

<br />

<Frame type="glass" caption="">
  <img src="/img/guides/12.png" alt="Screenshot 12" />
</Frame>
<br />

You may see this, if you do, please overwrite the file.

<Frame type="glass" caption="">
  <img src="/img/guides/13.png" alt="Screenshot 13" />
</Frame>
<br />

**Wait for it to finish uploading everything and then once it’s done let’s install the requirements.**

## Install Requirements & Restart the app[​](#install-requirements--restart-the-app "Direct link to heading")

Copy the command from your Python App from cPanel.

<Frame type="glass" caption="">

<br />

In a new tab, navigate to the terminal app.

<Frame type="glass" caption="">
  <img src="/img/guides/15.png" alt="Screenshot 15" />
</Frame>
<br />

Paste in the command and hit enter.

<Frame type="glass" caption="">
  <img src="/img/guides/16.png" alt="Screenshot 16" />
</Frame>
<br />

Type `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` .

<Frame type="glass" caption="">
  <img src="/img/guides/17.png" alt="Screenshot 17" />
</Frame>
<br />

Once it is done, go back to your `Setup a Python app` , hit the edit button, and then restart your Python app.
