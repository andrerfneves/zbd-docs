The Lightning Address enables frictionless user-to-user payments due to its human-readable nature. No longer are users sharing long strings of complex characters (e.g. lnbc1x0.....). We're now just a simple `user`@`provider.com` away! It’s super easy and intuitive.

**Anyone can now send and receive instantly-settled global payments. It’s as easy as sending an email.**

### Reward Payouts[​](#reward-payouts "Direct link to heading")

Many reward applications can also make use of a Lightning Addresses. Let’s say a user plays a game and earns some sats, then wants to claim their earned Bitcoin.

The game could ask the user to input their Lightning Address once, and it could let the payments fly automatically after a threshold has been met. Set it and forget it!

Another incredible feature that comes with truly programmable money is that one can build Splits with Lightning Addresses. Let's imagine a group of artists produced an album together, and are receive payment for it through their Lightning Address. The artists could easily specify a percentage breakdown to pay for each of the bands' members, and have those payments be split and settle on each of their wallets instantly.

That’s right! Someone purchases an album and upon receiving the successful payment, automatically fires off payments to each band member with their respective share, directly to their Lightning Address _no matter which Bitcoin Lightning provider they are using._
