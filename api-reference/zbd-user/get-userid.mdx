title: "Get ID by ZBD Username"
description: "Retrieve username from a ZBD user ID."
api: "GET https://api.zebedee.io/v0/user-id/gamertag/{GAMERTAG}"
---

<Warning>
  ZBD API is migrating the terms **ZBD Gamertags** to **ZBD Usernames**. There are no breaking changes to you as a developer, but beware of upcoming API changes

  In general, if you used to search for 'Gamertag' inside zbd.dev documentation, now search for 'Username'. Please do also note some ZBD API endpoints are still using `gamertag` in the URL.
</Warning>

## Description

Make use of this endpoint to get a given User's ID when provided with a ZBD Username.

## Usage

This is needed because ZBD Usernames are akin to social media handles, they are swappable. In the scenario where a Developer is using a ZBD Gamertag as the identifier for transaction limits and/or thresholds (for example), a user could simply change their ZBD Gamertag and try to bypass those constraints. Using a truly unique and immutable ID like the `User ID` will provide Developers with the needed assurances.

## Configuration

  ZBD Username
</ParamField>

### Header Parameters

<ParamField required header="apikey" type="string">
  ZBD Project API Key
