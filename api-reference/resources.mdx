## Utility APIs

When integrating ZBD API for payments capabilities in your system, it's important to have utility data points / functionalities available.

We've made a set of these Utility APIs available in the API Reference:

- [BTC USD Exchange Rate](/api-reference/utils/btc-usd) -> Fetches the latest price for 1 Bitcoin in USD
- [Is Supported Region](/api-reference/utils/is-supported-region) -> Fetches whether a user is located in a region ZBD services are available
- [ZBD Production IPs](/api-reference/utils/api) -> Fetches the static IP addresses for ZBD servers

## External Resources

The ZBD API abstracts away all of the complexity around the Bitcoin and Lightning Network protocols. But if you want to dig deeper, here are some developer tools to know:
