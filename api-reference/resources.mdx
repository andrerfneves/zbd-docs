## Utility APIs

When integrating ZBD API for payments capabilities in your system, it's important to have utility functions ready to help you go from 0 to 1.
We've made a set of these Utility APIs available to help you integrate faster.

## Troubleshooting

Below are some of the most common issues developers run into when integrating ZBD API.

### Cannot consume this service

If you receive a response from the ZBD API that resembles this message `you cannot consume this service` it means that you are likely using a Sandbox API key to invoke a Live API endpoint in the ZBD API (or vice versa). Try swapping from `sandbox-api.zebedee.io` to `api.zebedee.io` or vice versa, and trying again.

## External resources

The ZBD API abstracts away all of the complexity around the Bitcoin and Lightning Network protocols, so you only have to know how to interact with a simple API.

But if you want to dig deeper, here are some developer resources to know:
