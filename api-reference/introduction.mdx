## Overview

ZBD offers a powerful REST API that supports Bitcoin Lightning Network transactions with various payout and payin methods. Our API uses JSON data structures and makes use of industry standard HTTP response codes.

## Base URL

The ZBD API is available on the following base URL:

```bash
https://api.zebedee.io
```

<Note>If you're looking for the [Sandbox API](/api-reference/zbd-user/sandbox/send), that's available at `https://sandbox-api.zebedee.io`.</Note>

## Authentication

All ZBD endpoints are protected by an API Key. To make requests against these endpoints you must pass a header property called `apikey` with your [ZBD Project API Key](/docs/dashboard/projects/api).

```json
apikey: "1PnXYRdcm13NJrHZVzctgCAUIEniVomQR"
```

## SSL / HTTPS Access

**ZBD only provides a secure interface over HTTPS with SSL certificate support**. Any requests that attempt to reach the ZBD API in an insecure fashion (plain-text over HTTP requests) will be rejected.

<Note>Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) is the standard security technology for establishing an encrypted link between a server and a client. SSL allows sensitive information such as credit card numbers, social security numbers, and login credentials to be transmitted securely.</Note>
