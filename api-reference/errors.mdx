The ZBD API follows standard HTTP response codes for handling success and error requests.

<Note>If you are unfamiliar with HTTP requests, [please read more here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status).</Note>  

## HTTP status codes

Below is an overview of HTTP status codes available in the standard, which ZBD API adheres by:

| HTTP Response Group | Status Code Range |
| --- | :-: |
| Informational Responses | `100-199` |
| **Successful Responses** | `200-299` |
| Redirects | `300-399` |
| **Client Errors** | `400-499` |
| **Server Errors** | `500-599` |

## Common response codes

These are the HTTP status codes most often returned by the ZBD API.

| Status Code | Details | Response Description |
| :-: | :-: | --- |
| `200` | Success | Request was successful. |
| `400` | Bad Request | Either incorrect or missing parameters provided for the Request. |
| `401` | Unauthorized | Request is not authorized. Make sure correct API Key is provided. |
| `403` | Forbidden | Request is forbidden. Make sure your IP is located in a region/country that ZBD services are available in. |
| `404` | Not Found | The requested endpoint/resource was not found. |
| `422` | Missing Parameter | The requested endpoint expected a specific parameter to be provided. |
| `429` | Rate Limited | Too many requests in short time-frame. |
| `500` | Server Error | Something went wrong in the ZBD API servers. |

## Error messages

To help identify the issue with your API requests, the error JSON response returned will often include a **message** property that aims to be descriptive.

Example of an error message from the API:

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "Error creating Withdrawal Request: The \"amount\" property (in millisatoshis) is required.",
}
```
