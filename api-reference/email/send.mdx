## Description

Leverage this API to programmatically perform payments to emails. You can view this more detailed [guide](/knowledge-base/payouts/email), if needed.

- If the email is associated with an existing ZBD App account, then that user account will be credited the sats.
- Otherwise, the sats will be issued to the email in the form of a valid [ZBD Voucher](/docs/dashboard/vouchers) that the recipient can redeem in the [ZBD Mobile App](/docs/zbd-app/download). 

## Usage
