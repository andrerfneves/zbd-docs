title: "Get ID by ZBD Gamertag"
description: "Retrieve Gamertag from a ZBD user ID."
api: "GET https://api.zebedee.io/v0/user-id/gamertag/{GAMERTAG}"
---

## Description

Make use of this endpoint to get a given User's ID when provided with a ZBD Gamertag.

## Usage

This is needed because ZBD Gamertags are akin to social media handles, they are swappable. In the scenario where a Developer is using a ZBD Gamertag as the identifier for transaction limits and/or thresholds (for example), a user could simply change their ZBD Gamertag and try to bypass those constraints. Using a truly unique and immutable ID like the `User ID` will provide Developers with the needed assurances.

## Configuration

### Path Parameters

<ParamField required path="GAMERTAG" type="string">
  ZBD Gamertag
</ParamField>

### Header Parameters

<ParamField required header="apikey" type="string">
  ZBD Project API Key
</ParamField>
